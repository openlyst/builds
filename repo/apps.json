          "localizedDescription": "# 15.0.0\n\n## Highlights\n\n- **YouTube Music**: New provider (select in Server type). Search and stream without login. Home shows Harmony-style layout with Quick picks, Popular playlists, Trending; search shows Artists, Playlists, Songs.\n- **General options** (Settings > General): Toggles for Lyrics, Downloads, Volume on player bar, Queue button, Shuffle & repeat (desktop). YouTube Music can be re-enabled on Windows/Linux (off by default on desktop).\n- **Onboarding**: Language -> Theme (System/Light/Dark/OLED) -> Accent colour -> Get Started. Localized (English, 中文, Русский). When not logged in: welcome message and no-server screen after Get Started.\n- **Multi-server**: Add, edit, remove, switch saved servers without reload. Settings > Server lists saved servers; legacy single-server prefs migrate on first load.\n- **Detail headers**: Gradient derived from cover image (dominant color, darkened). Fades in over 280ms; no flicker. Shuffle/Play are circular icon-only; Shuffle in horizontal scroll on narrow panels.\n- **Artist/album/playlist**: Clickable artist names (no underline) open artist page when in library. Albums/Songs tab is animated segmented control (purple pill, 220ms). Tab bar full width, equal segments.\n- **Now playing**: Single responsive screen (mobile & desktop, breakpoint 900px). Compact: carousel, progress, controls, queue/favorite/lyrics/more. Expanded: album + controls left, Up Next / Lyrics right. Download in more-options: start, cancel, or delete download. Volume control. Close button clears queue and stops playback.\n- **Now playing polish (release pass)**:\n  - Desktop uses blurred artwork background and improved spacing for smaller heights.\n  - Play/pause visual treatment unified (no gradient orb styling).\n  - Volume controls support keyboard shortcuts and toggle-style panels.\n  - Queue and lyrics panels now hide/show contextually based on availability.\n- **YouTube Music follow-based home**:\n  - Home supports followed content and guidance when library is empty.\n  - Follow actions for artist/album/playlist with per-server persistence.\n  - Mix-style playlists are excluded from follow surfaces.\n- **Search**: Full-width bar. Shows albums, artists, songs for all providers; YouTube Music also shows community playlists. Server URL validation rejects YouTube Music with clear message.\n- **Dates**: Year/month/day (e.g. 2025/02/21) for album Added, Settings build date, log names.\n\n## Design & UI\n\n- **Organic refined** look: AppTokens (Plus Jakarta Sans + Nunito, teal accent, warm dark palette, soft radii). Same tokens on desktop and mobile; light, dark, OLED.\n- **OLED**: Pure black (#000000) everywhere when OLED theme selected. Dark mode uses charcoal (#1C1C1E).\n- **Gemini-style**: Dark palette (#0a0a0c page, #0e0e11 sidebar, etc.). Sidebar: purple logo box, rounded nav tiles, Library label, Settings at bottom. Settings sidebar: section headers, rounded cards, status (e.g. Connected).\n- **Dialogs**: Apple-style frosted glass (blur, rounded corners, scale/fade). showAppDialog / showAppConfirmDialog / showAppChoiceDialog (Apple* deprecated). Select Language, Theme, accent/custom color redesigned.\n- **Mobile**: extendBody so content under nav/player bars; bars use frosted glass. Bottom padding so content not covered by nav bar.\n- **Empty states**: Full-width centered icon and text. Home: no header; content starts with quick access and sections.\n- **Settings**: iOS-style grouped list (Server, Playback, Appearance, About), sub-pages. Connection shows Jellyfin username (User.Name) or \"Logged in\". Connection box adapts by provider (Local, YouTube Music, Jellyfin/Plex/Subsonic).\n- **Queue/lyrics overlays**:\n  - Current track is pinned at the top of queue presentations.\n  - Lyrics open at the current playback position.\n  - Lyrics tabs/buttons are hidden when lyrics are unavailable.\n\n## Fixes\n\n- **Queue**: Clear queue also clears current track and emits null so player bar hides.\n- **Layout**: Mobile nav no longer overflows on resize (Expanded + FittedBox). KeyedSubtree on breakpoint switch avoids _elements.contains assertion.\n- **Dialogs**: showAppleDialog (and Add/Edit server) use actionsBuilder so Navigator.pop uses dialog context-fixes \"Looking up a deactivated widget's ancestor\" when caller screen already closed.\n- **Search**: Bar no longer Expanded inside PageTemplate (layout crash); use fixed width (320px).\n- **Server settings**: Subsonic/Navidrome config data shown via displayServerUrl and displayUsername on login/restore.\n- **Now playing**: Album/artist lines under title have no underline. Lyrics: no yellow underline (TextDecoration.none).\n- **Now playing**: Volume overlay no longer blocks slider drag; tapping outside closes the overlay.\n- **Now playing**: Added mobile parity for The Mind Electric easter egg behavior.\n- **Settings**: Reliable scrolling (AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics, ConstrainedBox). Add/switch server no longer kicks you off Settings (shell keeps selection).\n\n## Removed\n\n- Android Auto, voice commands (Google Assistant, deep links, MEDIA_PLAY_FROM_SEARCH, shortcuts).\n- Dynamic Isle / mini player island. Standalone Local Music screen (config in Settings only).\n- Refresh buttons (Library, Albums, Artists, Playlists, Tracks, detail, Rescan). Login screen (main shell always; Connect/Disconnect in Settings).\n- Unused: cached_image.dart, apple_design/glassmorphism.dart. General settings section (OLED/Show album art moved to Theme dialog). Mobile-only UI.\n\n## Linux\n\n- YouTube Music disabled in Server type and saved list by default; if current server was YT Music on startup, app switches or disconnects.\n- YouTube Music playback: media_kit (mpv), setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, \"C\") before mpv to avoid \"Non-C locale\" crash. Fallback: ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf with ao=pulse,pipewire,alsa. Packaged .desktop uses LC_ALL=C.\n- Other Linux playback: audioplayers (GStreamer). Install gstreamer, gst-plugins-base, gst-plugins-good, gst-libav.\n\n## Refactors & performance\n\n- **Single codebase**: One set of Dart UI for mobile and desktop; sidebar >=768px, bottom nav on mobile. No ui/desktop vs ui/mobile split. Navigation in lib/services; theme in lib/ui/theme.\n- **Dialog API**: showAppDialog, showAppConfirmDialog, showAppChoiceDialog, AppDialogOption. Theme/layout in app_tokens.dart, desktop_theme.dart.\n- **Startup**: System info logging after first frame. Isolates for dominant color, cache/API JSON (Jellyfin, local). List keys, lazy tab loading, Selector for playlists/artists/albums. Now playing: AnimatedBuilder for skip/snap-back (no setState per tick); blur limited to header.\n- **YouTube Music**: Prefer 96-160 kbps stream; position-based completion fallback on mobile for auto-play/next.\n- **Lint**: mounted checks after async (media_details, settings_page); braces in now_playing lyrics.\n- **Cleanup**: Add-to-playlist consolidated (Create New Playlist in DesktopLayout; used from now-playing and home). ArtistDetailScreen vs ArtistDetailsPage clarified. Page template title: TextDecoration.none."
